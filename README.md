# Idea for Code.Fun.Do on Prediction & Management of Natural Disasters

A natural disaster can cause enormous damage to life and property. It should our goal to minimize the devastation caused by natural disasters. Technology if rightly used can contribute to saving several lives. 

Technology in handling natural calamities can be used in the following ways:
 - Prediction : Predict in advance the occurence of disasters like flood, tsunami etc. in order to ensure quick evacuation
 - Prevention : Take steps to prevent loss of lives and property etc.
 - Management (pre- & post- disaster) : It includes steps like evacuation, providing relief in the form of food and shelter etc.
 
## Prediction
 - Analyze and monitor rainfall pattern records and water levels of various dams to predict possibility of a flood.
 - Similarly present rainfall data and monsoon pattern can also give the idea of a possible drought in the future.
 - Disasters like tsunamis can be predicted if the earthquake in the ocean floor is close to the land. The approximate time of impact can be predicted to ensure faster evacuation of people.

## Prevention
 - For disasters which have an immediate impact time and which are large scale like floods, tsunami, earthquake etc. cannot be prevented. In such a scenario, however, technology can be used to save more lives. For example, in case of any of the above calamity, technology can help people know about a safe spot which is not impacted by disaster.
 - For long term disasters like droughts, steps can be taken in advance to prevent its occurence.
 
## Disaster Management
 - Immediately after a disaster, it is necessary that relief team is dispatched to the most affected areas. 
 - Technology can be used to locate people who are stranded at a location or who need immediate assistance.
 - Technology can be helpful in preparing smarter and better evacuation and relief plans before a diaster strikes.
 
# Our Proposed Solution 

- Installment of sensors in regions which are disaster prone, which can help to monitor the damages. Such sensors include devices which can measure water levels in case of flooding, measure wind speed in case of storms etc.
- The sensor data can be used to find safe locations and thus help in generating efficient evacuation plans. 
- Deployment of drones with cameras in the affected areas to monitor the areas and thus identify stranded people and the loss to property.(Use of vision)
- Similarly, the low pressure areas, depressions, cyclones, flooded regions etc. can be routinely monitored using satellite data in real time.
- Convey messages to the evacuation team via MCPTT (mission critical push to talk service, works without internet service). Usually during a disaster all means of communication are affected, so we need a technology which works even when internet, telecom towers etc. fail. MCPTT can be used by people to communicate with each other or relief teams.
- Generate rescue plans using vulnerability maps (3d Maps generation, evacuation paths). A good rescue plan would ensure maximum lives are saved.
- Systematic archival of seismic analog charts of historical importance in electronic form for doing prediction using Machine Learning models. Also Machine Learning models can be used for doing quick regression for parameter estimation of disasters like earthquakes to know the intensity and enery beforehand.
- Sea Level monitoring , both in deep sea and coast, robust communication and disemination system, decision support system , installation of warning systems, data center etc for reducing hefty amount of losses by doing pre planning.
