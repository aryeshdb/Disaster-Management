## Idea for Code.Fun.Do on Prediction & Management of Natural Disasters


- Prediction
- Prevention
Fast communication techniques for events which cannot be predicted beforehand like earthquakes
Facilities have also been created for scanning, vector digitization and systematic archival of seismic analog charts of historical importance in electronic form.(sort of prediction)



- Disaster Managementster     
Installment of sensors and computer vision techniques in various disaster prone areas to monitor the damages caused.
Use of Satellittes inspection techniques 
For eg_ water level sensors in flood affected areas to generate evacuation plan . Drone cameras deployment in the affected areas to monitor the loss.(Use if vision)
Convey messages to the evacuation team via MCPTT (mission critical push to talk servers, works well without internet s
ervice)
Generate rescue plans(via map models)
Installation of warning systems

compute earthquake parameters, simulated scenarios of travel time and run-up heights at 1800 coastal locations in the Indian Ocean, observing platforms for sea level variations, both in deep sea and coast, robust communication and dissemination system, data centre and decision support system
